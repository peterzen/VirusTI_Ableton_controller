# Ableton Live controller script for Access Virus TI

This is a controller script that can change the active part in a Multi patch, when a track is armed, keeping the TI's front panel controls in sync with the currently armed track in Live.

The script is based on [jzgdev' AbletonLive9_RemoteScripts](https://github.com/jzgdev/AbletonLive9_RemoteScripts)

Currently this is super rudimentary but usable.  If you get stuck, feel free to drop me a line.
